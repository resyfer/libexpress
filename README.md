# libexpress

REST API Framework for C. My implementation of Express in C, without actually
seeing the source code, with my flavour of how things should work both for the
consumer of the library as well as under the hood.

You will find the tutorial [here](/TUTORIAL.md),
documentation [here](https://libexpress-doxygen.netlify.app/) and the
installation instructions [here](/INSTALL.md).
